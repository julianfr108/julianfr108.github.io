        <h2>The Wounds of the Past Often Stay With Us</h2>
        <p>Trauma is the result of stressful and overwhelming experiences.</p>
        <p>This can be from a one time event or from living in an environment that is chronically stressful and unsafe. If this trauma is untreated, it can cause long term health issues such as inflammation, over reactivity, outbursts and breakdowns.</p>
        <p>It is important to process and heal trauma and stress sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>Trauma can be:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li><strong>Acute:</strong> From a single incident</li>
          <li><strong>Chronic:</strong> From repeated traumatic incidents</li>
          <li><strong>Complex:</strong> From different kinds of traumatic events experienced over time, such as growing up in an abusive environment</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Do You Recognize These Thoughts?</h2>
    <p>Someone with underlying trauma might say to themselves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"What is wrong with me?"</li>
      <li>"Why can't I just be normal?"</li>
      <li>"Why can't I just snap out of it?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Trauma Affects People</h2>
    <p>Trauma affects people in many ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For some, they often feel overwhelmed, lost, like they are out of control.</li>
      <li>For others, their unresolved trauma manifests in relationship struggles, social isolation, loneliness.</li>
      <li>And for many, it can result in serious anxiety and worry, as if the stress and fearful thoughts never stop - or in severe depression, a sense of hopelessness, without the motivation to engage in life.</li>
    </ul>
