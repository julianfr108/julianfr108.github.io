        <h2>Relationships Are Challenging</h2>
        <p>They are perhaps the most challenging - and also most rewarding - part of our lives.</p>
        <p>Many people wonder to themselves: "Everyone else seems to have a great relationship - why can't I?"</p>
        <p>The challenges that come along with relationships are many:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li>Struggling to find a committed relationship</li>
          <li>Wanting to heal or learn from a current relationship</li>
          <li>Dealing with the fear of losing their partner</li>
          <li>The fear that if they are truly honest, their partner will leave them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are all common struggles that can show up in our relationships.</p>

    <h2>Common Relationship Struggles</h2>
    <p>Not to mention the fear of being stuck, feeling held back, confusion, anger, resentment, and so on.</p>
    <p>Relationships take effort, and no matter how good things might seem, no relationship is perfect - and that is nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
    <p>Whatever struggles you may be experiencing in your relationship, you are not alone.</p>
