    <p>What It Means to Be a Fully Licensed Therapist</p>
  </div>
</div>

<section>
  <div class="container content-page">
    <h2>Why "fully licensed" matters</h2>
    <p>When you meet with someone calling themselves a "therapist," "counselor," or "mental-health professional," you want to know whether they are <strong>fully licensed</strong> (i.e., credentialed by the state to practice independently), or whether they are operating under a different title, or even in an unregulated role. Being fully licensed means you've met rigorous standards of education, training, supervision, ethical/regulatory oversight, and you're held accountable to a state board.</p>
    <p>In short: a <strong>licensed therapist</strong> is a regulated professional whose title is protected by law. A "life coach," "wellness coach," or other kind of coach may be helping people with personal growth and goals—but is <em>not</em> the same as a licensed therapist.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section-light">
  <div class="container content-page">
    <h2>What licensed therapists do</h2>
    <p>Licensed therapists provide mental-health and behavioural-health services. They typically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work with individuals, couples, families or groups around emotional, behavioural or relational concerns</li>
      <li>Assess, conceptualize and treat psychological difficulties (not just "helping someone figure out life goals")</li>
      <li>Are trained to recognise and respond to mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, trauma) and know when to refer for additional services (psychiatric, medical, crisis)</li>
      <li>Follow an ethical and legal framework governing confidentiality, professional boundaries, duty to warn/harm, competence, continuing education, etc.</li>
      <li>Hold themselves accountable to a regulatory body (in Colorado: the State Board of Licensed Professional Counselor Examiners via the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) for LPCs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For clients, this means knowing you're working with someone whose training and license are current, and who is legally allowed to provide defined services in that state.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="container content-page">
    <h2>How this differs from a "life coach" or other coaching role</h2>
    <p>While both coaches and therapists may use supportive, helping-conversations and aim to improve a client's life, there are key differences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Training and regulation:</strong> Therapists are required to meet state-licensing requirements (degrees, supervised clinical hours, examinations, continuing education). Coaches are typically not regulated by the state, and educational/certification requirements vary (and in many cases are minimal).</li>
      <li><strong>Scope of practice:</strong> Therapists can diagnose and treat mental health disorders (in their scope via license) and handle clinical issues such as trauma, emotional regulation, mental illness. Coaches typically focus on goal-setting, performance, personal growth, accountability, and do not diagnose or treat psychological disorders.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus of work:</strong> Therapists often explore underlying patterns, histories, emotional and relational dynamics; coaches tend to focus more on present/future goals, progress, behaviour change.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal protections and insurance:</strong> A licensed therapist offers services under regulated practice—there may be insurance reimbursement, ethical obligations, legal accountability. Coaching is largely unregulated, and clients must be clear that coaches are not licensed mental-health providers.</li>
      <li><strong>When to choose which:</strong> If someone is experiencing mental-health symptoms, emotional trauma, relational dysfunction or is in crisis, a licensed therapist is the appropriate fit. If someone is relatively healthy, goal-oriented, motivated for growth and change, a coach may help—but the person offering coaching should clearly state their credentials and scope.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short: A licensed therapist is a mental-health professional regulated by the state; a coach is a personal/professional development partner without the same regulatory safeguards or depth of clinical training.</p>
    <p><strong>Putting it plainly:</strong> If you want help unpacking why you think/do what you do, or if you're managing mental-health symptoms, seek a licensed therapist. If you want an accountability partner for a specific goal or life transition—and you're stable and healthy—you might choose a coach.</p>

    <h2>Requirements to Become a Fully Licensed Therapist in Colorado</h2>
    <p>Here's the pathway (as of this writing) for becoming a <strong>Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)</strong> in the State of Colorado. This is one of the most common "licensed therapist" credentials in Colorado; other licenses (e.g., Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist, Licensed Social Worker) have separate rules. Always verify current rules with the state board.</p>

    <h3>Pathway Summary</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Earn a <em>master's or doctoral</em> degree in counseling (or equivalent) from a regionally accredited institution, ideally a program accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling & Related Educational Programs (CACREP).</li>
      <li>During your graduate program ensure practicum/internship experience is included (many programs include required supervised client contact).</li>
      <li>After graduation (post-degree) accrue supervised professional experience: for master-level, generally <strong>2,000 hours</strong> of counseling work over at least 24 months, including a defined number of supervision hours (e.g., 100 supervision hours) and at least 1,500 hours of direct client contact under supervision.</li>
      <li>Supervision: At least <strong>100 hours</strong> of supervision (for master's) including minimum 70 hours face-to-face/individual. For doctoral level the post-degree requirement may be reduced (e.g., 1,500 hours) depending on board rules.</li>
      <li>Pass required examinations:
        <ul>
          <li>The Colorado mental-health jurisprudence exam (on state laws/rules for mental-health professionals)</li>
          <li>A national counselor exam (such as the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE) or the National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Exam (NCMHCE) administered by the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC))</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Apply for the LPC license via the Colorado DORA/DPO, submit transcript, proof of degree, proof of supervised hours, exam scores, fees.</li>
      <li>Once licensed, maintain continuing professional competency (CPC): In Colorado, LPCs must complete 40 professional-development hours (PDH) per renewal period (two-year cycle) and complete other documentation (learning plan, self-assessment).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key notes for students/aspiring therapists:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If your graduate program is not CACREP-accredited, you must submit an educational equivalency review through the Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE).</li>
      <li>Check any changes in rules: licensing boards update regulations. For example, boards may change supervision or exam requirements.</li>
      <li>Keep careful documentation of supervision hours, client contact, supervisor credentials.</li>
      <li>Licensing by endorsement (moving from another state) has its own rules.</li>
      <li>Starting early (e.g., registering as a candidate/provisional license) helps you accrue hours and understand your path.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <h3>For clients:</h3>
    <p>When you see a therapist with the proper licensing (in Colorado: LPC) you're working with someone who has met clearly defined professional standards. This offers more protection, a higher level of training and oversight, and a greater likelihood of being able to assist with more serious or deeper issues.</p>

    <h3>For students thinking of this path:</h3>
    <p>Knowing the pathway ahead helps you plan: which graduate program to choose, whether it's CACREP-accredited, how many hours you'll need post-graduation, what examinations you'll need to take—so you can budget time, money and career planning wisely.</p>

    <h3>For those already in school:</h3>
    <p>Use this as a checklist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure your coursework covers the required content areas (human growth & development, social/cultural foundations, helping relationships, groups, lifestyles/career development, appraisal, research/evaluation, professional orientation).</li>
      <li>Make sure your practicum/internship hours count toward the eventual supervised client contact requirement.</li>
      <li>Understand who qualifies as a supervisor in your state and under what conditions.</li>
      <li>Think ahead: once you graduate, you'll move into the post-degree supervision period—it's not just "graduate plus done," there's more to accrue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Becoming a fully licensed therapist in Colorado is a significant professional achievement: it represents advanced education, supervised professional experience, examination of knowledge, and ongoing ethical/regulatory oversight. The title "Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)" carries meaning in our state: you are prepared to provide mental-health care and work under regulated standards.</p>
    <p>Contrast that with coaching: a valuable service for many, but it lacks the regulated licensure, the mandate to treat diagnoses, the supervised clinical training, and the state board oversight. When you choose a therapist or pursue that career yourself, understanding the standards matters.</p>
