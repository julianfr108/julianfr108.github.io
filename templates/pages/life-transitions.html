        <h2>The Unknown Can Be Scary</h2>
        <p>There are periods in life where certain decisions can significantly alter our trajectory.</p>
        <p>These choices can weigh on us. It is hard not to second guess oneself, in such an important decision. Many times, we aren't sure which direction to go, or what choice to make.</p>
        <p>Facing a large life transition such as graduation, being fired, a break up, or feeling called to travel, and various other transitions, can be difficult.</p>

    <h2>Common Thoughts During Life Transitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"What should I do?"</li>
      <li>"What if I make the wrong choice?"</li>
      <li>"What do I truly want to do?"</li>
      <li>"What kind of life am I meant to be living?"</li>
      <li>"I'm afraid of messing this up"</li>
      <li>"I'm afraid of the unknown."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Confusion, uncertainty, doubt, fear of failure, of the unknown, of making a mistake - they can make such a period very challenging.</p>
